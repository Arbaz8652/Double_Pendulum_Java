# Double Pendulum Simulation in Java

This project simulates the dynamics of a double pendulum using Java. A double pendulum consists of two pendulums attached to each other, and it is a classic example of a chaotic system. The simulation visualizes the movement of the two pendulums, showing the complex motion and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, characteristic of chaotic systems.

## Features

- **Real-time simulation** of a double pendulum system.
- **Graphical visualization** using Java's Swing framework.
- **Adjustable parameters** such as pendulum length, mass, and initial angles.
- **Interactive controls** to adjust the initial conditions during runtime.
- **Chaos demonstration**, where small changes in initial conditions lead to drastically different outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher.
- A text editor or IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code) to modify the code if desired.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/double-pendulum.git
